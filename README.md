# Purpose
\
The first Homework assignment using JavaScript for the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp - Week Three. This is a short game of Hangman, built with the thought in mind of learning to use for loops, if/else statements, objects and other JavaScript functionalities. 

This is a short and interactive game between the user and a computer. When the user starts to play, they are asked to guess a street name by pressing different letters. When the user guesses the street name that the computer chose, they win the game and get a winning score.
